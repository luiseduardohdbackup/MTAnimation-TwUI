MTAnimation (for TwUI)
======================

This is an implementation we've included in our Mysterious Trousers [fork of TwUI](https://github.com/mysterioustrousers/twui). It is based off of [MTAnimation for iOS](https://github.com/mysterioustrousers/MTAnimation).

In the future, I will likely embed this in a demo project, but as of right now, this is pretty much unbuildable as a stand-alone project. I know this bad form, but I don't have time right now, I'll make it cleaner later.
